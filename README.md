# üñºÔ∏è Dashboard Photo Frame

Dashboard Photo Frame is a Home Assistant dashboard card overlaying your regular dashboard with pictures after a customizable delay of inactivity. The picture shown is based on the URL supplied by an arbitrary Home Assistant entity. Given you can integrate your photo library of choice with Home Assistant, you can use Dashboard Photo Frame to display your photos.

## Work In Progress

Dashboard Photo Frame can be installed through [HACS](https://www.hacs.xyz) by adding this repository as ["Custom Repository"](https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/?h=custom). However, Dashboard Photo Frame is still "Work In Progress" and under development at this time. As a result, things might not work as expected yet.
